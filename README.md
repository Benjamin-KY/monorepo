# Mito DS Monorepo

All of [Mito's](https://trymito.io) public code lives here. We're currently in the process of open-sourcing the core Mito application, and expect to be fully open source by the end of Feburary, 2022. Star our repo to see our progress.

## Mitosheet

Currently, there is just a stub folder for the Python `mitosheet` package. This will hold the code for the `mitosheet` package within the next few weeks.

## Trymito.io

To see the code for our website, see the `trymito.io` folder.
