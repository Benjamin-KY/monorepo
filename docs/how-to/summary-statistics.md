# Summary Statistics

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/6PrVk45JRn0" %}

Mito's column summary statistics are a quick and easy way of understanding column data. By default, Mito displays a histogram of the frequency of values in the column along with the result of using the .describe pandas function.&#x20;

To access Mito's Summary Statistics, open the **column control panel** by clicking on the **filter icon** in the column header, and then selecting the **Summary Statistics tab**.&#x20;
